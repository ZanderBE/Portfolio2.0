This is a complete redesign/upgrade from my previous portfolio. My biggest deciding factor in upgrading this portfolio was to develop an easy way to keep it updated. I was able to develop this portfolio to update/add projects in less than 5-10 minutes mainly using ReactJS and JSON file.
## General info
This project was built using React, Node, and CSS and uses an internal JSON file to make updating projects quick and easy.

After updating the file the code will handle the styling and addition of the project in this section of the portfolio:
